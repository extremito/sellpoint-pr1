# sellpoint-pr1
Spring React application to practice login, services and socket connections

This application has 2 parts:

1. A server created with Spring boot that lives in sellpoint-be.
2. A single page application created with React that lives in sellpoint-spa.

You can download the whole application and run both parts separately. In this moment the application does not have a way to run the whole application with one command.

Enjoy!!
